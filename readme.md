# Semantic  Protobuf

The goal is a robust framework for applying semantic web annotations to service definitions that should aid the documentation
and composition of services. By developers and autonomous agents.

## Components

* Option Definitions
The initial effort will be focused on developing the set of options that may be 
applied to methods, messages, and fields.
* Followed by a set of example service definitions
that leverage the option definitions to apply semantic content.
* Finally, a tool for extracting semantic content and rendering it as rdf triples.
